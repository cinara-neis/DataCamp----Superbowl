# DataCamp----Superbowl
Studying the Two Running Games in Super Bowl LVII


Every February millions of people, both inside and outside of North America, tune into the National Football League's Super Bowl, which crowns the world champion in American football. In football there are two ways to advance the football while on offense; running and passing. During this training, you will learn how to use data to see which players to watch out for during Super Bowl LVII in the running game, the more unheralded aspect of a football game. We will show you how to obtain NFL play-by-play data in Python and then use exploratory data analysis and linear models to show which players will be the ones to watch during Super Bowl LVII.
